# Pull Request

The easiest way to submit changes to the code is through a GitHub pull request. To do this, you need to create a GitHub account and sign in. Then, visit the GitHub site for Apache Wayang and create a fork. This will create a copy of the Apache Wayang repository in your account that you can make changes to. Once you have made your changes and are ready for them to be reviewed, you can create a pull request by going to your forked repository page on GitHub and clicking the “New Pull Request” button. This will notify us of your changes and allow us to review and discuss them before accepting and merging them into Apache Wayang.
